The following list of APIs will be growing as the [WebDriver BiDirectional Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) grows
and browser vendors implement the same.
Additionally, Selenium will try to support real-world use cases that internally use a combination of W3C BiDi protocol APIs.

If there is additional functionality you'd like to see, please raise a
[feature request](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature.md).
