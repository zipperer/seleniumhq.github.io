   Puppeteer has moved over to support WebDriver BiDi getting full support in Chromium browsers and Firefox.
---

The Selenium Project has always been fully supportive of creating a standard to improve the quality
of the web that we use. We started with the [WebDriver Specification](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver) and over the last couple of years have been working
with the Safari, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox teams on the [WebDriver-BiDi specification](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi).

Today, we are celebrating that [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) has moved over to using [WebDriver-BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi), the new WebDriver Specification
that allows WebDriver clients to have event driven APIs instead of the synchronous way Selenium has done it before.

This new protocol allows us to be able to do things Selenium always wanted to do but was never surfaced to us in a
meaningful way. We have documented all the latest additions to Selenium, thanks to WebDriver-BiDi, in our [documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidi/)

You can read about the latest changes on [Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/08/puppeteer-support-for-firefox/)
and on the [Chrome Developer Blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/firefox-support-in-puppeteer-with-webdriver-bidi?hl=en).

Congratulations to everyone in making this a reality and supporting a standardised web!
