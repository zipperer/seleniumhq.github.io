We're very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.19.0 for 
Javascript, Ruby, Python, .NET, Java and the Grid!
Links to everything can be found on our [downloads page][downloads].

### Highlights

  * Chrome DevTools support is now: v121, v122, and v123 (Firefox still uses v85 for all versions)
  * Thanks to Selenium Manager's [records usage](https://plausible.io/manager.selenium.dev), we know Selenium has at least 1.8M active users in the last 30 days!
  * Java and JavaScript keep adding more WebDriver [BiDi] features.
  * The WebDriver [BiDi] features in Java have a new home, read it at Puja's [blog post](/blog/2024/bidi-java-breaking-change).


#### Noteworthy changes per language

  * Java 
    * `se:bidi` was removed from the session response when starting a Grid session, as `webSocketUrl` is enough.
    * Memory allocation and thread handling was improved in Grid.
    * Add missing event handlers for TargetLocator interface in `WebDriverListener`.
    * Several [BiDi] additions: adding `setFiles` command of the Input Module, between others. 
    * [See all changes](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/CHANGELOG)
