    Announcing a new Development partnership tier with Sauce Labs, celebrating our supporters!
---

Selenium has witnessed an exceptional year filled with expansion and progress. The rising 
popularity of Selenium's Python Bindings is prominently showcased through the engaging 
discussions at the Selenium Conference and on LinkedIn. Concurrently, the Java bindings have 
reached a significant landmark, surpassing 100 million downloads. In addition to this, 
the community has managed to garner over [2.5 million active](https://plausible.io/manager.selenium.dev) 
Selenium users monthly.

We could not have achieved Selenium's 20th anniversary without the collective efforts of numerous 
volunteers and the invaluable assistance of a company like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/resources/topic-hub/selenium?utm_source=selenium&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=selenium-sponsorship-fy25).

In 2008, Jason Huggins, Selenium's creator, established Sauce Labs, a company that has since 
played a crucial role in Selenium's expansion.

Sauce Labs has provided a platform for the Selenium Project to display its accomplishments, 
including various keynotes at SauceCon. Here, figures like Simon Stewart and Jim Evans have been 
able to share their visions for the future of Selenium.

Financially, Sauce Labs has substantially supported the Selenium Project, sponsoring both the 
project itself and the Selenium Conference over many years. This backing has been instrumental 
in allowing the project to flourish.

Selenium thrives on collaboration, and Sauce Labs has been a vital facilitator. They have 
enabled the Selenium Project to host in-person events like the Test Automation Summit in Berlin 
in 2022. These gatherings have provided opportunities for members of the Selenium Project to 
engage with creators of different testing frameworks, fostering discussions on ecosystem 
improvements. Sauce Labs has also hosted Selenium Dev Summits, where the project's future has 
been a central topic.

Sauce Labs contributions extend beyond financial support. They have significantly contributed 
to the technical and organizational well-being of the Selenium Project. Boni Garcia developed 
the first version of Selenium Manager while at Sauce Labs. Furthermore, several Sauce Labs 
employees, including Marcus Merrell, Diego Molina, and Titus Fortner, continue contributing 
to the Selenium project, driven by their passion. This passion is shared by Sauce Labs, 
enabling these contributions to be part of their daily work.

This unwavering support has nurtured a project governed openly, not by a single entity, but 
by the community. This model has welcomed diverse contributors, including Google Chrome, 
Microsoft, Apple, LambdaTest, Applitools, BrowserStack, and Mozilla Firefox teams. Together, they 
have developed WebDriver BiDi, the next generation of WebDriver.

The project's open governance and collaborative nature have allowed continuous work on client 
bindings, particularly WebDriver BiDi, community support, documentation improvements, and 
maintenance of additional projects.

Sauce Labs has been an unnamed development partner for the Selenium Project for many years. 
With this in mind, the Selenium Project now shows its appreciation to Sauce Labs for their 
years of continued support by creating a new sponsorship tier called the Development Partner 
and naming Sauce Labs the first and official Development Partner.

Sauce Labs has Selenium in its DNA, and Selenium has Sauce Labs in its DNA. This partnership 
celebrates their shared history and future. We are excited to see what the future holds for 
both Selenium and Sauce Labs, and we are excited to continue to work together for the next 
twenty years.
