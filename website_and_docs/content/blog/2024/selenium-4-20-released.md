We're very happy to announce the release of Selenium 4.20.0 for 
Javascript, Ruby, Python, .NET, Java and the Grid!
Links to everything can be found on our [downloads page][downloads].

### Highlights

  * Chrome DevTools support is now: v122, v123, and v124 (Firefox still uses v85 for all versions)
  * Selenium has at least [2.3M active users](https://plausible.io/manager.selenium.dev) in the last 30 days. 500k more than last month!
  * Java and JavaScript keep adding more WebDriver [BiDi] features.
  * .NET C# and JavaScript now publish [nightly builds to GitHub packages](/downloads/#nightly).
  * Nightly packages are tested daily with the examples from the Selenium [documentation](/documentation). 
  * The code used to invoke Selenium Manager has been refactored in all languages, making it easier to maintain and improve. 
    * The interface has changed and if users were invoking it, they might experience issues. 
      Selenium Manager is still in beta and these type of changes are expected. 


#### Noteworthy changes per language

  * Java 
    * Browser containers provisioned in Dynamic Grid will use the hostConfig
    * Dynamic Grid re-fetches browser images if they were pruned during runtime
