    The Selenium project is a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy, a 501(c)3
    non-profit organization. The Conservancy has allowed us to pool organizational
    resources with other projects, such as Inkscape, Samba, and Wine, in order to reduce
    the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.
	</p>
	<p class="lead mb-0">
    The majority of sponsorship funds go directly towards supporting the Selenium project,
    such as server and software expenses. A small portion of the funds are set aside for
    the Conservancy to continue their work in supporting Selenium and other open source
    initiatives.

      <p>
        Our goals are straightforward: we aim to enhance Selenium by performing tasks such as
        code reviews, specialized bug fixes, and paying hosting bills, all for the benefit of
        the entire Selenium user community and the public. Additionally, we want to enable
        sponsors to make tax-deductible donations and publicly recognize these contributions.

    <div class="w-lg-75">
      <p>
        The Selenium project will consider the value of non-monetary donations
        to the project - for example, donations of hardware, software licenses,
        or hosting - on a case-by-case basis. We will set a sponsorship level
        appropriately. We note that non-monetary donations may not be tax-deductible;
        to confirm, you should seek the counsel of a qualified tax professional.
        In general, we suggest cash donations, as that process is much simpler.

    <div class="w-lg-75">
      <p>
        Bronze sponsors can donate through our
        <a href="https://opencollective.com/selenium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Collective</a>
        profile.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-4">
        For larger donations (Silver and higher), we request that payment is remitted by check
        or wire transfer. This ensures 100% of the donation goes to the project and that we
        don't pay unnecessarily large transaction fees. To pay by check, make it payable to
        "Software Freedom Conservancy" and write "Selenium Sponsorship" in the "memo" field.
        Checks should be sent to the following address, so that the Conservancy can process them:
